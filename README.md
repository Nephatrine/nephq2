###NephQ2

This is my fork of [Quake II VR](https://github.com/q2vr/Quake2VR/), an Oculus Rift-enabled Quake II engine based on the [KMQuake II](http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/) engine and inspired by [RiftQuake](https://github.com/phoboslab/Quakespasm-Rift).

####Features
- Oculus Rift Support (SDK 0.4.4)
- SteamVR Support
- Gamepad Support

####Play Requirements

- You should own [Quake II](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2320/) as you'll need the assets from it.
- Obviously for VR to work, you'll need a supported HMD like the **Oculus Rift**.

####Build Requirements

You'll at a minimum require these libraries as I cannot distribute them:

- [Oculus SDK 0.4.4](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/)
- [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/)

I will include precompiled binaries for the following libraries (Windows MSVC 2013). If you are using a different platform, then you will need to download and build these yourself.

- [GLEW 1.12.0](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [SDL2 2.0.3](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
